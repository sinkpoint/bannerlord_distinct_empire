# Description
Makes the 3 regions of empires to have more distinct troop trees, so the empire is less monotonous. 
Each region now adopt elements of other cultures surrounding them, to better counter the babarian troops they encounter.

### Northern Empire
The north is surrounded by Sturgia to the north, Khuzait to the east, and Battania to the west. Sturgia and Khuzait proved to be the biggest challenge to the Northern territories. To counter the large shield formations of Sturgia, infantry start to equip axes instead of the traditional spatha. Reforms to infantry training also incorporated northern babarian practice of using two handed axes for shock troop, but further inclusion of axes was resisted by the upper echolon of Menavliatons. The inclusion of more Khuzait migrants also raised the horse riding skill of the general populace. Horse archer training was included in veteran archery training and noble recruits to resist the eastern Khuzait threat. Crossbow development was soon put to a halt, and the expensive technology became only accessible to the most elite troops.

### Southern Empire
Southern geography faces the light calvary threat from both the Khuzait to the east and the Aserai to the south.
The horse archer mass from both geographies meant the Southern empire adopted large social reforms, where horse riding was no longer the sole privilege of the nobles. This resulted in vastly more available light calvary troops for the empire. Infantry also started to carry more javelins to counter light calvary encirclement. The successful reforms unfortunately neglicted crossbows, and the quality became lower tier, as other empire kingdoms started to limit high quality crossbow exports to the Southern kingdom in fear of its growing militray capacity.

### Western Empire
While the Western empire faces the Battanian to the north, its most dire threat is the heavy calvary of Vlandia. Instead Western empire's conservative society resisted calvary reforms, and instead focused on infantry development. Even the mounting danger of Aserai horsemen to the south did not dissuade western elites. The infantry now includes pike training, and phalanxes from the bygone era was dugged up in hoping to counter heavy calvary charges. The empire also doubled down on heavy crossbow technology to compete with Vlandia. Noble recruits are now expected to become expert swordsmen to serve the northern borders. Some lip service is paid to horse archer training, of course that is reserved to the noble children.
